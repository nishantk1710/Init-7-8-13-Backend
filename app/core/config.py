"""Environment-driven application settings.

Values are read from the process environment first and from a local ``.env``
file as a fallback, so the same code runs unchanged locally and on Azure App
Service (where settings are supplied as environment variables).

Nothing here is required for startup: every future-integration setting defaults
to empty so the app -- and the health endpoint -- come up with no SAP, database
or identity credentials present.
